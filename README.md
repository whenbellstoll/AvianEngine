# AvianEngine
## 2D node-based cross-platform game engine

## Currently getting our house in order, parts of the Readme may not be up to date or describe things currently in development

Avian is a light-weight, extendable, easy to develop game engine.
It provides all the basic tools that developers need without being so restricting that they cannot implement more robust features for their own games. 
The little overhead Avian provides keeps performance high, but provides enough of base as to be powerful enough to make complex multi-platform games quickly.

Avian as a Game Development Tool has two major components:
* AvianCore 
* AvianEditor

AvianEditor is the tool that helps users develop games that will run with AvianCore. 
This can be accomplished in a short period of time with minimal hassle and without the need to acquire an advanced stage of programming skills.

Although games can be fully developed without the need to install or use the editor, it aids beginners and experienced devs alike to rapidly produce 2D games that will look and feel like those games produced by professional game developers.
It provides the different tools that help to define a game in terms of a visual heiarchy and produces the C++ code required by AvianCore to run. 
It saves a lot of time specifying countless coordinates needed in moving objects or in defining collision points by providing visual tools that will facilitate this. 
The goals of this engine are to provide a straightforward, well documented, beginner friendly entry into game development, and the editor is engineered for this purpose.

Refer to the Docs included in this repository to learn more functionality of both AvianEditor and AvianCore.
