## Reporting bugs

The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. 
If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.

If you're reporting a new bug, you'll make our life simpler, and the fix will come sooner, by following these guidelines:

### Search first in the existing database

Issues are often reported several times by various users. 
It's good practice to **search first in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/whenbellstoll/AvianEngine/issues) before reporting your issue**. 
If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. 
The team will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.

### Specify the platform

Avian runs on a variety of platforms and operating systems and devices.

**In your bug reports, please always specify:**

* Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 10, macOS 10.15, Ubuntu 19.10)
* Release version (e.g. 1.0, 1.5 or the Git commit hash if you're using a development branch)

For bugs that are likely OS-specific and/or graphics-related, please also specify:

* Device (CPU model including architecture, e.g. x86, x86_64, ARM, etc.)
* GPU model (and the driver version in use if you know it)

**Bug reports not including the required information may be closed.** 
If in doubt, always include all the requested information; it's better to include too much information than not enough information.

### Specify steps to reproduce

Many bugs can't be reproduced unless specific steps are taken. 
Please **specify the exact steps** that must be taken to reproduce the condition, and try to keep them as minimal as possible. 
If you're describing a procedure to follow in the editor, don't hesitate to include screenshots.

Making your bug report easy to reproduce will make it easier for contributors to fix the bug.

### Provide a simple, example project

Sometimes, unexpected behavior can happen in your project. 
In such case, understand that:

* What happens to you may not happen to other users.
* We can't take the time to look at your project, understand how it is set up and then figure out why it's failing.

To speed up our work, **please upload a minimal project** that isolates and reproduces the issue. 
This is always the **best way for us to fix it**.
You can attach a ZIP file with the minimal project directly to the bug report, by uploading the file in the GitHub edition field.

We recommend always attaching a minimal reproduction project, even if the issue may seem simple to reproduce manually.

**If you've been asked by a maintainer to upload a minimal reproduction project, you *must* do so.** 
Otherwise, your bug report will be closed as it'll be considered too difficult to diagnose.

## Contributing pull requests

If you want to add new engine features, please make sure that:

* This functionality is desired, which means that it solves a common use case that several users will need in their real-life projects.
* You talked to other developers and / or contributors on how to implement it best.
* Even if it doesn't get merged, your PR is useful for future work by another developer.

Similar rules can be applied when contributing bug fixes - it's always best to discuss the implementation in the bug report first if you are not 100% about what would be the best fix.

### Document your changes

If your pull request adds methods, properties or signals that are exposed to core features of the engine, you **must** update the class reference to document those.
This is to ensure the documentation coverage doesn't decrease as contributions are merged.

If your pull request modifies parts of the code in a non-obvious way, make sure to add comments in the code as well. 
This helps other people understand the change without having to look at `git blame`.

### Write unit tests

When fixing a bug or contributing a new feature, we recommend including unit tests in the same commit as the rest of the pull request. 
Unit tests are pieces of code that compare the output to a predetermined *expected result* to detect regressions. 

Pull requests that include tests are more likely to be merged, since we can have greater confidence in them not being the target of regressions in the future.

For bugs, the unit tests should cover the functionality that was previously broken. 
If done well, this ensures regressions won't appear in the future again. 
For new features, the unit tests should cover the newly added functionality, testing both the "success" and "expected failure" cases if applicable.

Feel free to contribute standalone pull requests to add new tests or improve existing tests as well.

### Be nice to the Git history

Try to make simple PRs that handle one specific topic. 
Just like for reporting issues, it's better to open 3 different PRs that each address a different issue than one big PR with three commits.

When updating your fork with upstream changes, please use ``git pull --rebase`` to avoid creating "merge commits". 
Those commits unnecessarily pollute the git history when coming from PRs.

Also try to make commits that bring the engine from one stable state to another stable state. 
For example, if your first commit has a bug that you fixed in the second commit, try to merge them together before making your pull request (see ``git rebase -i`` and relevant help about rebasing or amending commits on the Internet).

The agis [Git style guide](https://github.com/agis-/git-style-guide) has some good practices to have in mind.

TODO: See our [PR Workflow](https://www.duckduckgo.com) documentation for further information.

### Format your commit messages with readability in mind

The way you format your commit messages is quite important to ensure that the commit history and changelog will be easy to read and understand. 
A Git commit message is formatted as a short title (first line) and an extended description (everything after the first line and an empty separation line).

The short title is the most important part, as it is what will appear in the `shortlog` changelog (one line per commit, so no description shown) or in the GitHub interface unless you click the "expand" button. 
As the name says, try to keep that first line under 72 characters. 
It should describe what the commit does, while details would go in the description. 
Typically, if you can't keep the title short because you have too much stuff to mention, it means you should probably split your changes in several commits.

Here's an example of a well-formatted commit message.
Note how the extended description is also manually wrapped at 80 chars for readability:

```text
Prevent Air Conditioner failure by fixing sealment

When using the Air Conditioner's cooling module, Avian would not regulate the heat
and thus bring the room to uncomfortable temperatures, causing unwanted side effects 
in the physics engine.

By fixing the seal via an added blanket object on to the Window interface,
this commit now ensures that Avian will not go past the equilibrium temperature
that would cause excessive sweating and discomfort under normal atmospheric conditions.

Fixes issue #864, long live Kansas City!
```

**Note:** When using the GitHub online editor or its drag-and-drop feature, *please* edit the commit title to something meaningful. 
Commits named "Update my_custom_class.cpp" won't be accepted.

## Communicating with developers

The Avian Engine community has several communication channels, some used more for user-level discussions and support, others more for development discussions.

To communicate with developers (e.g. to discuss a feature you want to implement or a bug you want to fix), the following channels can be used:

* [GitHub issues](https://github.com/whenbellstoll/AvianEngine/issues): 
    * If there is an existing issue about a topic you want to discuss, just add a comment to it - all developers watch the repository and will get an email notification. You can also create a new issue - please keep in mind to create issues only to discuss quite specific points about the development, and not general user feedback or support requests.
* [The Avian Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/QYHgdaZZH5): 
    * You will find core developers there, so it's the go-to channel for direct chat about development. Feel free to start discussing something there to get some early feedback before writing up a detailed proposal in a GitHub issue.

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
